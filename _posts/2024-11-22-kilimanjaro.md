The toughest climb of my life, Kilimanjaro, will forever be etched in my memory.
Months of preparation couldn’t fully prepare me for the sheer challenge of this monumental hike, but every step was worth it.

Over six days, we took the Marangu route, starting from the Marangu Gate and ascending to Uhuru Peak, the highest point in Kilimanjaro National Park.
This journey led us through successive huts along the route, each marking a higher elevation and a step closer to the summit. Along the way, the landscape transformed dramatically, as if we were travelling through entirely different worlds.
From tropical rainforests to moorlands, arid desert tundra, and finally the icy arctic expanse near the summit, the diversity of climates was breathtaking and surreal.

The initial hikes between huts were deceptively manageable, feeling no harder than the preparatory walks back home.
With a steady pace and the help of altitude sickness medication, we managed to stave off severe symptoms, allowing us to tackle the roughly five-hour treks each day without too much discomfort.

But nothing could compare to the final summit push.
At 11 PM on our penultimate night, we began the gruelling ascent to Uhuru Peak under the cover of darkness.
The air was thin and icy, our pace deliberately slow to conserve energy as we made our way to Gilman’s Point.
From there, we edged along the crater rim of the dormant volcano, battling exhaustion and freezing temperatures, until we finally reached Uhuru Peak — 5,895 metres above sea level.

The sense of accomplishment was overwhelming.
Standing on the roof of Africa, watching the sunrise paint the horizon, was a moment of pure awe and pride.
The hike to the summit was no easy feat; even now, it feels like a mystery how I found the strength to complete it.

This experience has left a mark on me.
While I hope to embark on more adventures in the future, I’m not sure anything could rival the challenge, or the rewards, of climbing Kilimanjaro.
Though next time, I might choose an adventure that doesn’t involve scaling another mountain!
