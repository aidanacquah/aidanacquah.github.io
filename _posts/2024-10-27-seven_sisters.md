The Seven Sisters Cliffs Walk isn’t just one of the most famous hikes in southern England; it’s a must-do for anyone prepping for a beast like Kilimanjaro.
It's not just about the breathtaking coastal views, but also puts your grit and endurance to the test.

Setting off from Seaford, a quiet coastal town just over an hour’s train ride from London Victoria, we stepped onto the pebbled beach under typical British clouds.
Despite the weather, Seaford’s laid-back charm gave us a scenic start.
As we began, the trail was unexpectedly gentle, a level stroll along the shore dotted with colourful beach houses.

Soon, though, the climb began, and at the first summit, the “Seven Sisters” cliffs unveiled themselves in a dramatic row.
The cliffs seemed tantalisingly close, and we were all buzzing, speculating on finishing early (spoiler: we were wrong).
We wound down the hillside towards the sea, spotting a few others wading into the Channel waters.
Here, we hit our first major choice: cross the river as the tide was relatively low, or detour around it to avoid wet shoes for the rest of the hike.
Tempted as we were by the low tide, we opted for caution, not wanting to risk a slip before the real climb.

The path to Exceat took us through thick mud, by far the hardest stretch of the hike.
Keeping our footing while avoiding an embarrassingly muddy ride home was a struggle.
In hindsight, the thought of that short, elusive river crossing lingered in our minds the entire hour we spent navigating to the bridge.
But at last, we made it across and rejoined the coastal path.

From here, it was a series of steep ascents and descents as we traversed the iconic cliffs.
The views were stunning, especially as the sun began to set, casting a golden glow.
As we neared Eastbourne, the trail took us down steeply, skirting football fields just as dusk began to fall.
In a last push, we hit the pavements of Eastborne's main roads, passing by grand Victorian hotels
I was surprised I’d heard so little of Eastbourne before this hike.
Even after reaching the town, Eastbourne Station felt miles away.
A solid 40-minute walk within the town brought us to our final stop, where we finally sank into our train seats, embracing the well-earned rest on our way back to London.

In total, the hike took about six hours, with no major breaks taken.
Every step, every ascent and descent was worth it—the Seven Sisters Cliffs Walk delivered the most jaw-dropping views I’ve seen in southern England, and it’s easy to see why this trail has earned such a reputation.
