London is often thought of as a bustling urban metropolis, yet it holds many hidden pockets of greenery that offer a respite from the city.
In my latest hike, I had the opportunity to explore a unique route that allowed me to visit a series of parks across North and East London.
This hike was not only refreshing but also gave me a new perspective on the capital.

The journey began at Hampstead Heath, a vibrant and scenic area in North London.
Hampstead Heath is known for its natural beauty, dotted with charming cafés and restaurants.
It’s easily accessible via the Overground at Hampstead Heath station, making it a perfect starting point for urban hikes.
The lush greenery of Hampstead Heath was immediately visible on leaving the station.
After a brief uphill walk, I was rewarded with a spectacular view of the London skyline.
From this vantage point, landmarks such as the BT Tower, The Shard, and other skyscrapers were visible on the horizon.

Despite being relatively central, the hike felt far removed from the chaos of urban life.
The route took me through a series of interconnected parks, each offering its own unique charm.
One particularly memorable part of the walk involved following what seemed to be an abandoned railway line, with the tracks long gone but the path still intact.
This peaceful stretch soon led us to Finsbury Park.

Finsbury Park itself is a large and popular green space, and though we didn’t spend much time there, it served as a perfect midpoint on the journey. After a short break, we continued towards our next destination.
The Walthamstow Wetlands are a vast nature reserve located just outside central London, home to an abundance of wildlife.
Unfortunately, we didn’t have the chance to explore the wetlands on this particular hike, as they weren’t part of the planned route.
Instead, we saved it for another day and continued onwards, taking a right turn to follow the River Lea.

The final leg of the hike took us along the River Lea, a scenic waterway that winds through East London.
The peaceful riverside walk was a perfect way to wind down after covering such a long distance.
As we continued along the river, we eventually reached Stratford, our final destination.

Looking back, I thoroughly enjoyed this hike. The distance—about 20 kilometres in total—was challenging, especially towards the end when I could feel the burn in my legs.
However, the effort was worth it.
Seeing this side of London, where the natural world blends seamlessly with the urban environment, was a real treat.
