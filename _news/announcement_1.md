# Pre-print submission

After two long years, I am happy to announce a new pre-print of work investigating the association between median daily steps and incident Parkinson’s disease in the hashtag#UKBiobank.

Current research has proposed that being more active may help prevent Parkinson’s disease (PD). This is because those who report less activity are more likely to be diagnosed with PD. However, there are concerns that people are unreliable in reporting how active they are, and lower activity may be due to early signs of the disease, rather than a risk factor causing the disease.

This analysis used smartwatch data, processed used machine learning algorithms to extract daily steps, with the stepcount package, available at: [https://pypi.org/project/stepcount/](https://pypi.org/project/stepcount/). The results show a strong association between high daily steps and reduced risk PD. However, no association is found when only considering diagnosed cases at least 6 years after the study. These results therefore provide no evidence for low daily steps increasing the risk of PD, but rather a strong predictor of individuals likely to go on to get a PD diagnosis within 6 years.

The pre-print is available here: [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.13.24311539v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.13.24311539v1). Please note that this is still just a preprint and not yet peer-reviewed.
