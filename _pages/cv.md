description: I am an experienced data analyst and software engineer in both commercial and academic spaces. I worked full-time as an Analyst Programmer at Tessella Ltd, where I developed software solutions for large clients in diverse sectors, including BP, Rolls Royce, and Unilever. Following this, I began my PhD in Health Data Science, investigating how wrist-worn accelerometers could be used to better predict Parkinsonâ€™s disease. I bring a unique blend of academic rigour and practical knowledge, allowing me to navigate both research environments and real-world commercial projects. I am now looking to apply my skills in industry to have a broader impact, directly benefiting consumers and making a tangible difference in their lives.
