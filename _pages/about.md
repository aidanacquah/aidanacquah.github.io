Hello, and welcome to my About Me page.
My hope is that this page can give you an introduction to me.

I was born in London, UK, into a family of Ghanaian heritage.
I have spent much time in both UK and Ghana, absorbing a mix of both cultures.
After graduating with an IB diploma from a boarding school in Ghana, I returned to the UK for univesity.
For my undergraduate degree, I studied [Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/biomedical-engineering/), receiving a Masters in Engineering (MEng).
Following this, I embarked on a consulting role with a Software Development and Data Analytics company named [Tessella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessella), that is today part of the [Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/).
My job allowed me to work for a variety of clients from different locations, including Burton-on-Trent, Stevenage, Den Haag and Abingdon.
After three years there, I decided to return to academia to do a [CDT in Health Data Science at the University of Oxford](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/study/cdt).

One of my greatest passions is travelling.
My aspiration is to set foot on every continent before turning 30, although time seems to be slipping away.
In the upcoming year, I hope to be able to travel Tanzania, Iceland and Puerto Rico, each holiday offering something slightly different.
Through my travels, I've come to appreciate the value of learning multiple languages, a challenging pursuit I'm committed to.

As an enthusiastic sports fan, I enjoy a wide array of athletic pursuits.
Bouldering is a personal favorite whenever leisure allows, and my childhood passion for football remains a part of me.
I have aspirations to reignite my interest in running, as I was a regular participant in my local [Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/), but haven't gone for some time.
I have also recently taken up hiking, and am hoping to summit Kilimanjaro soon.

Gaming, despite my somewhat limited skills, also occupies a space in my life.
I spend a decent amount of time in the online gaming community on platforms like Twitch and YouTube.
[Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/) drew my interest, and while I was a devoted fan of Pok√©mon and Runescape in my youth, I've come to realize that gaming prowess doesn't come naturally to me.
However, my newfound fascination with Dungeons and Dragons has kindled an interest in Baldur's Gate 3, prompting me to consider forming a gaming group.

As a software developer, I have a proficiency in numerous programming languages including MATLAB, C, C++, SQL, C#, Python, R, Java, and JavaScript.
I have a growing interest in various coding related personal projects, like developing an indie game.
However, I have grown to appreciate the importance of maintaining a clear separation between work and leisure, leading me to limit my coding activities to work-related pursuits for now.

In terms of aspirations, my hope is to live a balanced life of work and leisure.
I find that my greatest joys in work are in research, discovering new patterns in acquired data that can potentially benefit the lives of millions.
I also hope to be able to spread the knowledge and training I have received to young minds in less privileged areas, particularly in Ghana.
Furthermore, I'm committed to fostering a more diverse collection of data in the field of Health Data Science, thereby addressing the biases that arise from skewed dataset populations.
