Hello, I'm Aidan, and welcome to my About Me page.
I've crafted this page to provide a more comprehensive introduction to myself than a CV can offer.
I trust you'll enjoy reading it, and I'm open to any feedback you may have.

I was born in London, UK, into a family of Ghanaian heritage.
My life significantly changed when I transitioned from my local state school in London to a private secondary school in Accra, Ghana.
Following this, I transferred to a different high school in Ghana and ultimately graduated with an IB diploma.
I then returned to London to pursue a degree in [Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/biomedical-engineering/).
After achieving a Master's in Engineering, I embarked on a consulting role with a Software Development and Data Analytics firm named [Tessella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessella).
My job allowed me to work from Burton-on-Trent, Stevenage, Den Haag and Abingdon.
Three years later, driven by a desire to further my academic pursuits, I chose to delve into a [CDT program in Health Data Science at the University of Oxford](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/study/cdt).
All in all, I have worn many labels, including British, Ghanaian, health data scientist, biomedical engineer and software developer.

Beyond the realms of my professional and academic endeavors, I actively cultivate a vibrant social life, recognising its positive impact on my mental well-being.
One of my greatest passions is traveling.
My aspiration is to set foot on every continent before turning 30, although time seems to be slipping away.
The upcoming years hold plans for explorations in Colombia, Australia, Tanzania, and The Philippines.
Through my travels, I've come to appreciate the value of learning multiple languages, a challenging pursuit I'm committed to.
While I seek to enhance my proficiency in languages I already grasp, such as French and Twi, I also intend to grasp basic expressions in unfamiliar tongues like Spanish and Arabic.

As an enthusiastic sports fan, I enjoy a wide array of athletic pursuits.
Bouldering is a personal favorite whenever leisure allows, and my childhood passion for football (soccer) remains a part of me.
I have aspirations to reignite my interest in running, as I was a regular participant in my local [Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/), a motivation that has waned recently.

Gaming, despite my somewhat unpolished skills, occupies a space in my life.
I spend a decent amount of time in the online gaming community on platforms like Twitch and YouTube.
[Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/) drew my interest, and while I was a devoted fan of Pok√©mon and Runescape in my youth, I've come to realize that gaming prowess doesn't come naturally to me.
However, my newfound fascination with Dungeons and Dragons has kindled an interest in titles like Baldur's Gate 3, prompting me to consider forming a gaming group.

As a software developer, I've honed my proficiency in numerous programming languages including MATLAB, C, C++, SQL, C#, Python, R, Java, and JavaScript.
Although I dedicate my leisure hours to developing personal projects, I've recognized the importance of maintaining a clear distinction between work and leisure.
As a result, I have come to limit my coding activities to work-related pursuits.
My current focus involves crafting machine learning models using Python and conducting statistical analyses using R.

In terms of aspirations, my ultimate goal is to disseminate the wealth of knowledge and insights I've gained from my academic journey.
Having been fortunate to access extensive knowledge and research through institutions like Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, I'm driven to bridge the gap between this invaluable information and eager, young minds in less privileged areas, particularly in Ghana.
Furthermore, I'm committed to fostering a more diverse collection of data in the field of Health Data Science, thereby addressing the biases that arise from skewed dataset populations.
